These are community-member created Kicad files based on the DXFs available for the Kyria Plate case. 

Included are gerber archives ready for upload to a PCB manufacturer such as JLCPCB.

We would suggest having them produced in 1.2mm FR4 or Aluminium PCB materials.

Typically the minimum order quantity for such manufacturers is 5 PCBs; this will get you two (and a half) sets of plates.
